1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    Allows for quick front-end building, and handles large amounts of data easier by updating only specific components.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    Breaking projects into individual components so that it can be easily scalable.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational      component.
    Functional components can't have state, and thus focus on UI and not the functionality of the site. Class components have state, access to props/this.

4.  Describe state.
    A component decides its own state. This property should be declared inside of a constructor method.
    
5.  Describe props.
    Information that gets passed from one component to another.
